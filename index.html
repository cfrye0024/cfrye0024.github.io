<h1>Clyde</h1>
<img src="Clyde.JPG" style=width:400px>
<p> Clyde is actually no longer with us. He died of heart disease in June, 2017.</p>
<li>* I always say he was a <b>special</b> needs cat as he constantly followed me around, wanting my attention.</li>
<li>* Clyde wasn't afraid of anything...except ceiling fans. He did not like them at all.</li>
<li>* His favorite place to be was on my lap.</li>

<h2>Sammy</h2>

<p> Sammy is also no longer with us. He died in March 2018.</p>
<li>* My wife rescued Sammy when she lived in Florida and had him for 16 years.</li>
<li>* He <em>loved</em> to burrow himself in blankets. It was very interesting watching his process of doing that.</li>
<li>* We used to take him to the local parks quite often and walk a few miles each time.</li>

<h3>Bonnie</h3>

<img src="Bonnie 2.jpg" style=width:400px>
<p> Bonnie is actually Clyde's twin sister and she is still with us. She is currently 11 years old.</p>
<li>* She stayed out of the limelight while we had Clyde and Sammy. Now that they are gone, <b>she is out and about</b> and loving it!</li>
<li>* She spends most of her day moving throughout the house in order to find the sunlight.</li>
<li>* She likes to sploot (laying down with her legs extending behind her). Never knew what that was called until recently.</li>
